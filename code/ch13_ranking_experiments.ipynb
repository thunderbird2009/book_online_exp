    "### Understanding the Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the power calculation function, let's understand the two critical parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **effect_size**: What Does It Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `effect_size` parameter represents the **expected absolute difference in per-query P-Interleaving scores** between Algorithm A and Algorithm B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This is NOT a percentage lift in business metrics like CTR!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the numbers mean:**\n",
    "- `effect_size = 0.01` means that, on average across queries, Algorithm A's score minus Algorithm B's score equals **0.01** in absolute terms\n",
    "- This is the **expected value** of the difference distribution: E[score_A - score_B] = 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context for interpreting effect sizes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Section 5.2 that P-Interleaving scores are calculated as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Score = Σ (PositionWeight / ExposureProbability)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With position weights = 1/k (where k is position):\n",
    "- Position 1: weight = 1.0\n",
    "- Position 2: weight = 0.5\n",
    "- Position 3: weight = 0.33\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with balanced interleaving (ExposureProbability = 0.5), a single click contributes:\n",
    "- At position 1: score contribution = 1.0 / 0.5 = **2.0**\n",
    "- At position 2: score contribution = 0.5 / 0.5 = **1.0**\n",
    "- At position 3: score contribution = 0.33 / 0.5 = **0.67**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical effect sizes:**\n",
    "- **0.005**: Very small difference (Algorithm A gets slightly more high-position clicks)\n",
    "- **0.01**: Small meaningful difference (detectable with ~10K queries)\n",
    "- **0.02**: Medium difference (detectable with ~3K queries)\n",
    "- **0.05**: Large difference (detectable with ~500 queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why so small?** Most queries have zero clicks (score = 0 for both algorithms). The effect size reflects the average difference across ALL queries, including the majority with no clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **baseline_click_rate**: Modeling Data Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "The `baseline_click_rate` parameter models the **fraction of queries that receive at least one click**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it's used in simulation:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important:** The \"effect size\" in interleaving experiments refers to the **absolute difference in per-query scores**, not a percentage lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect size = 0.01** means: E[score_A - score_B] = **0.01** (absolute difference)\n",
    "- This is NOT a 1% relative lift (that would be written as \"1% improvement\")\n",
    "- It represents the expected absolute difference in the bias-corrected scoring metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Example:**\n",
    "- Suppose for a query, Algorithm A gets score_A = 0.50 and Algorithm B gets score_B = 0.51\n",
    "- The difference is 0.51 - 0.50 = **0.01** (this is the effect size)\n",
    "- This 0.01 absolute difference, when consistent across many queries, indicates B is better\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why such small numbers?**\n",
    "- In P-Interleaving, scores are weighted by 1/position (1, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, ...)\n",
    "- A typical query might have score around 0-2 (depending on clicks)\n",
    "- So 0.01 absolute difference is meaningful relative to typical score magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship to CTR:**\n",
    "- baseline_ctr = 5% means ~5% of queries have clicks (affects how many non-zero differences we observe)\n",
    "- The effect size 0.01 is independent of this CTR - it's about the magnitude of score differences when clicks occur"
